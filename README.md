## About Who Wants To Know?

Our squad, ThreeS Amigos, built this app to our requirements for project number three.  The deployment requirements change and database requirements change delayed our progress on this project approximately six hours.  Each of us, Don Powers, Tony Leo, and Lisa Smith all worked on every aspect of this project as a triplet, a pair, or individually.

[Who Wants To Know?](https://github.com/threes-amigos/three-amigos-client) lets users design their own survey that has answers on a range from 1 to 5.  The survey can be created from the browser, viewed, and deleted and the survey name can be updated.  At creation of a survey, three questions can be created with a choice for answers from 1 to 5. The questions persist and are related to that particular survey.  The dashboard displays a particular survey and it's associated questions.  Each question displays the number of times anyone has submitted an answer to the survey and then also the average score for a particular question.

Who Wants to Know? is built using HTML, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, Handlebars, Express and relies on Mongo DB/Mongoose to persist data. Code for that API can be found at [three-amigos-express-api](https://github.com/threes-amigos/three-amigos-express-api).

  Due to time constraints, we were unable to spend the time needed to create more elaborate wireframes.  We spent considerable time researching Bootstrap templates for our app.

## Development Process

We spent a lot of time working the Github workflow, meeting during and after class hours in our own homes to have a solid plan.  We held regular standups--twice per day at minimum, discussed and updated our thorough project plan, and coded side-by-side for the entire project as a team.  We traded off roles several times so we all have a stake in every part of the project--coding/pair coding/individual, api/client.  Our cohesion as a team grew although integration of the various parts of the code was a challenge, as well as the Git commands/integration.  We revisited the plan often to make sure we were spending our time working on the most important tasks.
